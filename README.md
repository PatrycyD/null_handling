# null_handling
Null values and handling them is important part of all people who work with data. There are many ways to deal with them - fill them with some aggregate, 
remove variable from model or fill it in more complicated way - for example creating functions.

In this experiment I handled null values using five different methods and after implementing ML algorithms (logistic regression and XGBoost) evaluated each null values handle method and its impact on final results of qine quality classification
