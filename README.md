# null_handling
Null values and handling them is important part of working with data. There are many ways to deal with them - filling them with some aggregate, removing variable from model or fill it in more complicated way - for example using functions or implementing algorithm.

In this experiment I handled null values using five different methods and after implementing ML algorithms (logistic regression and XGBoost) evaluated each null values handle method and its impact on final results of qine quality classification
